I am pursuing a **Master of Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS)** in the Department of the Built Environment, while simultaneously earning an **M.S. in Artificial Intelligence（online)** from the **University of Colorado Boulder**.

My journey began in the tech industry as a **Product Planner at Tencent**, where I witnessed firsthand how algorithms influence user behavior. Now, I leverage that industry experience to fuel my academic research.

My work sits at the intersection of **Technology, Urban Science, and Humanities**, with a specific focus on:

* 🎮 **Game Studies:** Analyzing how video games function as "digital laboratories" for historical reconstruction, algorithmic nationalism, and architectural rhetoric.
* 🤖 **AI & Society:** Investigating the impact of Artificial Intelligence on urban planning and social safety, including crime analysis and support systems for vulnerable populations.
* 📊 **Data Science:** Applying machine learning models to solve complex social inquiries and visualize urban dynamics.

I am always looking for new ways to combine data science with social theory.
