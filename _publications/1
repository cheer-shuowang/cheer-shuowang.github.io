## Abstract

Old urban districts often suffer from static bus stop layouts that fail to meet dynamic travel demands and the accessibility needs of aging populations. This study proposes a novel optimization framework integrating multi-source data fusion, **Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (STGCN)**, and multi-objective integer programming. 

We utilize STGCN to capture spatial-temporal dependencies, achieving a **25% improvement** in passenger flow prediction accuracy over traditional ARIMA models. Subsequently, a multi-objective optimization model is constructed to balance coverage fairness, travel time, and operational costs. 

Validated in Qingdao’s core district, the optimized layout improved dynamic supply-demand matching by **18.6%** and reduced average wait times by **12.3%**, providing a data-driven solution for urban micro-renewal and smart transportation.
